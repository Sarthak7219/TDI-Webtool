ABOUT:
Tribal Development Index (TDI) Web Tool
The Tribal Development Index (TDI) Web Tool was developed to simplify the calculation of the Tribal Development Index, replacing complex Excel methods with a streamlined, interactive web application. This tool provides tribe-wise and district-wise TDI calculations, with a focus on visualizing and exporting results to facilitate data-driven insights.

KEY FEATURES:
- TDI Calculations: Provides a platform for accurate Tribal Development Index calculations.
- Data Visualization: Results are displayed through bar graphs and pie charts to improve understanding and comparisons.
- Downloadable Reports: Users can download calculated results in Excel and PDF formats for documentation and sharing.
- Interactive Map Navigation: Features a map of Jharkhand for intuitive district selection, enhancing usability.

MY CONTRIBUTIONS:
This project, conducted under the guidance of Professor Harshit Lakra from the Department of Architecture at IIT Roorkee, involved extensive data analysis, parameter relationship identification, and data validation processes. Key contributions include:
- Processed and validated survey data containing over 5,000 entries across 29 tribes and 24 districts in Jharkhand, ensuring calculation accuracy and consistency.
- Developed Python-based calculations for complex TDI metrics, leveraging Pandas to handle and process large datasets.
- Converted Excel-based calculations into optimized backend code, resulting in faster and more accessible TDI computation.

TECHNOLOGY STACK USED:
- Backend: Python (Django), using Pandas for data processing and validation.
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap for a responsive and intuitive user interface.
- Data Visualization: Chart.js for rendering interactive bar and pie charts.
- Database: MySQL for secure and structured data storage.
- Hosting: Render, enabling easy access and scalability.
